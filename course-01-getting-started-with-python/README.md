# 🚀 Course 01 – Getting Started with Python

This folder contains all my work, notes, and code from **Course 1** of the *Python for Everybody* specialization on Coursera, taught by [Dr. Charles Severance (Dr. Chuck)](https://www.py4e.com/).

It's part of my personal commitment to mastering Python from the ground up — not just for certificates, but for building real-world AI tools, full-stack applications, and automation systems under my personal brand **1FahadShah**

## 🧠 What I Learned

This course covers the very basics of Python programming and lays the groundwork for writing real Python scripts.

### ✅ Topics Covered:
- Installing Python and writing first scripts
- Using `input()` and `print()` functions
- Working with variables and expressions
- Writing conditional logic with `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Building loops using `for` and `while`
- Understanding and creating basic functions

## ✍️ Notes

- These are **beginner-level exercises**, but they are foundational for everything that comes next.
- I documented everything manually to stay consistent and internalize syntax deeply.
- I learn best by **writing first**, then coding — hence the handwritten notes.
- These scripts may seem basic, but they are the **core muscles** of Python fluency.
- All code is written from scratch without copy-pasting — to build true problem-solving skills.
- I’ll be using the Self Study Notes to revisit and reinforce core concepts throughout my journey.
