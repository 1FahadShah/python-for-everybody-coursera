# 🚀 **Course 03 – Using Python to Access Web Data**

This folder contains all my assignment code, datasets, and course certificate from **Course 3** of the *Python for Everybody* specialization on Coursera, taught by [Dr. Charles Severance (Dr. Chuck)](https://www.py4e.com/).

It’s a critical chapter in my journey to master Python as a practical tool for **web scraping, data parsing, API integration, and automation pipelines** — all under my personal brand **1FahadShah**.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This course goes beyond local scripting and dives deep into **accessing web-based data**, using Python to interact with webpages, parse HTML/XML/JSON, and call real-world APIs. These skills are foundational to building AI workflows, backend systems, and intelligent automation.

### ✅ Topics Covered

#### 🌐 HTTP, Sockets, and urllib
- Performing raw `GET` requests via low-level `socket` programming
- Using `urllib.request` to fetch HTML/text from the internet
- URL parsing with `urllib.parse`

#### 🔍 Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup
- Parsing HTML documents using `BeautifulSoup`
- Navigating tag structures, extracting values from `<span>` and `<a>`
- Building a mini crawler that recursively follows URLs

#### 🔣 Regular Expressions
- Using `re.findall()` to extract all numbers from messy text
- Solving pattern-based scraping challenges with regex + file parsing

#### 🧩 JSON Data Parsing
- Working with nested dictionaries and lists using `json.loads()`
- Handling static and dynamic API responses
- Extracting, aggregating, and interpreting structured data

#### 🏷️ XML Data Parsing
- Navigating XML trees using `ElementTree`
- Using `.find()`, `.get()`, and `.findall()` to pull hierarchical info
- Counting elements and summing values from XML APIs

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python 3.x  
- VS Code  
- Git + GitHub for version control  
- `socket`, `urllib`, `re`, `json`, `xml.etree.ElementTree`  
- `.txt`, `.xml`, `.json` datasets provided by Py4E

## ✍️ Notes

- These scripts are real-world prototypes — scraping, parsing, and cleaning raw web data without third-party automation libraries.
- I built API clients, mini-crawlers, and ETL logic entirely from scratch to gain low-level control and understanding.
- The knowledge from this course lays the **web foundation for AI agents, backend APIs, and automation tools** that I’ll develop under **1FahadShah**.
- This course trained me to *extract structured truth from unstructured mess* — a key superpower in any data-driven system.
