# 🚀 Course 02 – Python Data Structures

This folder contains all my assignment code and course certificate from **Course 2** of the *Python for Everybody* specialization on Coursera, taught by [Dr. Charles Severance (Dr. Chuck)](https://www.py4e.com/).

It’s part of my ongoing journey to master Python fundamentals with a focus on clean logic, structured thinking, and real-world problem solving — all under my personal brand **1FahadShah**.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This course focused on Python’s built-in data structures and showed how to extract, process, and analyze data from text files — a crucial skill in automation, backend systems, and data pipelines.

### ✅ Topics Covered

#### 📦 Lists
- Indexing, slicing, appending, and membership testing (`in`)
- Removing duplicates by filtering (`if word not in list`)
- Processing user inputs to calculate aggregates (Assignment 7.2)

#### 🧠 Dictionaries
- Key-value mapping for counting patterns
- Using `.get()` for safe lookups and frequency tallies
- Building histograms (emails, hours, word counts)

#### 🔗 Tuples
- Tuple unpacking with `.items()`
- Sorting dictionaries by value using `sorted()` and `lambda`
- Finding the most frequent sender or max key (Assignments 9.4, 10.2)

#### 📂 File Handling
- Reading files using `open()`, line iteration, `.strip()`, and `.split()`
- Parsing and extracting structured data from raw lines
- Using text files like `mbox-short.txt`, `romeo.txt`, and `words.txt`

#### 🔍 String Parsing Techniques
- Using `.find()` and slicing to extract values (Assignment 6.5)
- Multi-stage `.split()` parsing for timestamps, emails, and numbers
- Conditional line filtering with `startswith()`

#### 🧮 Aggregation & Pattern Recognition
- Calculating averages from extracted values
- Building dictionaries to count categories (senders, hours)
- Identifying maximum and sorted patterns from real data

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python 3.x  
- VS Code  
- Git + GitHub for version control  
- `.txt` files from Py4E (`mbox-short.txt`, `romeo.txt`, `words.txt`)

## ✍️ Notes

- These aren’t just assignments — they’re **mini scripts practicing core real-world logic**: extracting, transforming, counting, and organizing text-based data.
- I’ve written each solution from scratch, using clean patterns I’ll reuse in **automation, AI pipelines, and backend services**.
- This course taught me how to **think like a parser and problem solver**, not just a coder.
